# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Real Estate Pricing

## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real estate dataset. The goal is to extract key insights about the pricing of properties based on various features. The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## 2. Project Structure
- `Project_3_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_(EDA)_for_Real_Estate_Pricing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the EDA code and analysis.
- `housing_data.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis (ensure this file is in your working directory).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
## 3. Objectives
-  Analyze the distribution of real estate prices.
-  Identify factors that significantly affect pricing.
-  Visualize the relationships between variables using various plots and charts.
-  Provide insights for data-driven decision-making in real estate.
## 4. Dataset
-  The dataset includes various features like property size, location, number of bedrooms, and more.
-  The source of the dataset is available.

# Methodology
## 1. Data Preprocessing:
-  Handle missing data, outliers, and incorrect data types.
-  Feature scaling and transformation where necessary.
## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
-  Summary statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots).
-  Correlation analysis.
-  Identification of key trends and relationships in the data.
## 3. Visualization Tools:
-  Matplotlib
-  Seaborn
-  Pandas visualization capabilities
# Libraries Used
-  Pandas
-  NumPy
-  Matplotlib
-  Seaborn
# Notebooks
-  Project_3_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_(EDA)_for_Real_Estate_Pricing.ipynb: The main notebook where all the analysis is conducted.
# Visualizations
## This project includes visualizations such as:
-   Price distribution across different categories.
-   Correlation heatmaps between numerical features.
-   Pair plots to visualize relationships between multiple variables.
# Conclusion
-   The EDA provides a foundation for deeper analysis or model building in real estate pricing prediction.
